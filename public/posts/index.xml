      <description>(Starting Note: This is an abridged/&amp;lsquo;cheat sheet&amp;rsquo; version of a much, much longer transformer explainer. If you want to read the long version, you can find it here!)
GPT-4 predicts what word will follow a sequence of text. How does GPT work?
If you google for “GPT model”, you find a graphic that looks like this:
This graphic gives a nice bird’s-eye view of a GPT model. But while it shows what steps happen in a GPT model, it doesn’t show how each step works.</description>

      <description>Hello! My name&amp;rsquo;s Grace, and I&amp;rsquo;m trying to understand neural networks. Welcome to my blog!
I&amp;rsquo;m most excited by questions around ML interpretability and robustness. Perhaps a silly way of summarizing my interests is &amp;lsquo;I want to learn to think like a neural network, and I want neural networks to learn to think like us.&amp;rsquo;
I&amp;rsquo;m also a rising third-year undergrad at Haverford College (go fighting Quakers!), where I&amp;rsquo;m studying CS, math, and a sprinkling of philosophy.</description>
