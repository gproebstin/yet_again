GPT-3 predicts what word will follow an inputted sequence. **How does GPT work?** 

If you google for “GPT model”, you find a graphic that looks like this:

This graphic gives a nice bird’s-eye view of a GPT model. **But while it shows _what_ steps happen** in a GPT model, **it doesn’t show _how_ each step works**. 

To clarify what is actually going on at each step of the GPT graphic, I made an  annotated version, pictured below. I hope it can be of help to anyone confused about the ‘specifics’ of the GPT model architecture (e.g. my past self!)

(I don’t provide much detail on the notation, parameters, and operations I refer to in the graphic below, so don’t worry if things seem confusing at first! For more explanation, [please see the much longer version of this explainer](https://highdimensionalgrace.com/posts/big_transformer/). :)

I hope this graphic was helpful! As mentioned previously, you can also find a more detailed version of this explainer [here](https://highdimensionalgrace.com/posts/big_transformer/).
