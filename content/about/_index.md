Hello! My name's Grace, and I'm trying to understand neural networks.

I'm most excited by questions around ML interpretability and robustness. Perhaps a silly way of summarizing my interests is 'I want to learn to think like a neural network, and I want neural networks to learn to think like us.'

I'm also a rising third-year undergrad at Haverford College (go fighting Quakers!), where I'm studying CS, math, and a sprinkling of philosophy.

If you are also trying to understand neural networks, I'd love to chat! Feel free to reach out at grace.proebsting@gmail.com.
